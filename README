Introduction
------------

FilterFS (Filter File System) is a FUSE-based virtual filesystem that allows
filtering existing filesystems. Filters consist of include/exclude rules which
are stored in a filter chain, similar to the way iptables stores IP filtering
rules for network packets. The virtual filesystem can be accessed through a
specified mount point where all files are included and excluded according to the
rules found in the filter chain. Rules can be provided with command line
parameters or options in the system's fstab file.

FilterFS can be useful in various scenarios where parts of the filesystem need
to be hidden from a user or where filtering files simplifies certain use cases.
For example, it can be used to export only certain audio files of a filesystem
where additional metadata such as pictures or playlists are stored next to the
audio files. This makes it easier to copy whole subtrees with audio files to an
MP3 player without filling the player's flash memory with unnecessary metadata.
In a more enterprise-centric environment, it would be possible to export
filtered network shares which only allow storage of specific document types
based on predefined file extensions.

Usage
-----

Include and exclude filters are specified on the command line or alternatively
in the system's fstab file with the following parameters:

  -I <pattern> OR --include=<pattern> OR -oinclude=<pattern>

  -X <pattern> OR --exclude=<pattern> OR -oexclude=<pattern>

The -o syntax takes the form of a mount option, which is needed to specify these
in the system fstab. In place of any of the <pattern> placeholders above
multiple patterns separated by colons can be used, yielding e.g.:

  -I <pattern>[:<pattern>[...]] or --exclude=<pattern>[:<pattern>[...]]

The default action for a FilterFS filesystem is to exclude all files that cannot
be matched by any rule. It is also possible to override this default behaviour
and include all unmatched files with the following parameter:

  --default-include

The order that rules are provided on the command line is the same as their order
in the filter chain.

The following example shows how to create a filtered filesystem that only allows
audio files and playlists::

  filterfs /data/audio /data/filtered-audio --include=*.flac:*.mp3:*.m3u:*.m3u8

The following is a more complex example that implements an advanced chain of
include and exclude rules::

  filterfs /data/audio /data/filtered-audio --exclude=temporary*.log:*.cue 
  --include=*.log --include=*.flac:*.mp3 --default-include

It is also possible to mount FilterFS filesystems with the system's fstab file.
This would require an entry in /etc/fstab such as the following::

  #filterfs#/mnt/audio /mnt/filtered-audio fuse allow_other
  ,exclude=temporary*.log:*.cue,include=*.log:*.flac:*.mp3,default-include  0  0

Note that mounting FilterFS filesystems with the fstab file requires the
/sbin/mount.fuse utility from the fuse-utils package.
